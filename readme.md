Conclusions for Task 7:

Based on the results of the Monte Carlo simulation (1,000,000 throws), the obtained sum probabilities are very close to the theoretical (analytical) calculations.

The maximum probability, as expected, falls on the sum of 7 (about 16.6%).

The minimum probabilities are for the sums of 2 and 12 (about 2.7%).

The difference between the experimental and analytical values is negligible (within the margin of error for random sampling), which confirms the correctness of the simulation algorithm and the Law of Large Numbers.
